# Install POSIX Threads for Windows using vcpkg in MSVC

## Step 1: Install vcpkg

1. **Download vcpkg**:
   - Open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) and navigate to the directory where you want to install **vcpkg**. For example:
     ```bash
     cd C:\dev
     ```
   - Clone the vcpkg repository from GitHub:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
     ```

2. **Build vcpkg**:
   - Navigate into the `vcpkg` directory:
     ```bash
     cd vcpkg
     ```
   - Build `vcpkg` using the provided build script:
     - For Visual Studio 2019 or later (MSVC):
       ```bash
       .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
       ```

3. **Add vcpkg to your PATH** (Optional but recommended):
   - Add the `vcpkg` directory to your system’s `PATH` so you can run `vcpkg` from any terminal window.
   - To add it to the `PATH` environment variable, go to **System Properties** > **Advanced** > **Environment Variables**, and add a new entry under **User variables** or **System variables**:
     - **Variable Name**: `VCPKG_ROOT`
     - **Variable Value**: `C:\dev\vcpkg` (or wherever you cloned the repository)

## Step 2: Install POSIX Threads Using vcpkg

1. **Install pthreads** using `vcpkg`:

   - Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) and navigate to the `vcpkg` directory.
   - Install the POSIX thread library (`pthreads`) by running the following command:
     ```bash
     .\vcpkg install pthreads
     ```

   This will automatically download and build the POSIX threads library (pthreads) for Windows and MSVC.

2. **Install specific triplets for MSVC**:
   - If you're using MSVC, you can specify a triplet for 32-bit or 64-bit Windows by running:
     ```bash
     .\vcpkg install pthreads:x64-windows
     ```
     Or for 32-bit:
     ```bash
     .\vcpkg install pthreads:x86-windows
     ```

3. **Link vcpkg with your MSVC project**:
   - You need to tell MSVC to use the `vcpkg` installed packages by setting the **VCPKG_ROOT** environment variable in your project settings. This can be done by adding the following to your Visual Studio project properties:
     - **VC++ Directories** > **Include Directories**: Add `$(VCPKG_ROOT)\installed\x64-windows\include`.
     - **VC++ Directories** > **Library Directories**: Add `$(VCPKG_ROOT)\installed\x64-windows\lib`.
     - **Additional Dependencies**: You may need to link the pthreads library explicitly (e.g., `pthreadVC2.lib`).

## Step 3: Set Up Visual Studio to Use vcpkg

1. **Integrate vcpkg with Visual Studio**:
   You can integrate `vcpkg` into Visual Studio to automatically manage dependencies:
   - Run the following command from the `vcpkg` directory:
     ```bash
     .\vcpkg integrate install
     ```
   - This will configure Visual Studio to automatically use `vcpkg` to find and install any required libraries in your MSVC projects.

2. **Verify the integration**:
   - Open **Visual Studio**, create or open a C++ project, and build it.
   - If `vcpkg` is properly installed and integrated, you should be able to add headers from any installed libraries (like `pthread.h`) and use them directly.
