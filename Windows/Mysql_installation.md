# MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench Installation Guide for Windows

## Step 1: Download MySQL Installer
1. Go to the [MySQL downloads page](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/).
2. Download the **MySQL Installer for Windows** (it should be labeled as **MySQL Installer Community**).
   - Choose the **"Windows (x86, 32-bit), MSI Installer"** version (this is the easiest option).

## Step 2: Run the MySQL Installer
1. **Launch the MySQL Installer** you just downloaded.
2. You'll be prompted to choose a setup type:
   - **Developer Default**: This installs MySQL Server, MySQL Workbench, MySQL Shell, and other useful tools.
   - **Server Only**: Installs MySQL Server only.
   - **Custom**: Allows you to select individual components.
   
   **For most users, select "Developer Default"** for a complete installation.

3. Click **Next**.

## Step 3: Select the Products to Install
1. The installer will display a list of products to install. For the **"Developer Default"** setup, it should automatically select:
   - **MySQL Server** (the core server)
   - **MySQL Workbench** (the GUI tool)
   - **MySQL Shell** (a powerful command-line interface)
   - **MySQL Router** and **MySQL Utilities** (optional)
   
2. If needed, you can change the components to install by selecting **Custom** during setup.

3. After reviewing, click **Next** to proceed.

## Step 4: Resolve Dependencies (if any)
1. The installer will check for any missing dependencies and install them. This might take a few minutes.
2. Once completed, click **Next** to continue.

## Step 5: Choose Installation Path
1. You can leave the default installation path (`C:\Program Files\MySQL\`) or change it if needed.
2. Click **Next**.

## Step 6: Configure MySQL Server
1. The MySQL Installer will now take you through the **MySQL Server configuration** process.
   
### **Configuration Options**:
- **MySQL Server Type**:
   - **Development Computer**: Optimized for testing, development, or personal use.
   - **Server Computer**: Optimized for production servers.
   - **Dedicated MySQL Server Machine**: For high-performance production servers (useful for heavy workloads).

   **For most users, choose "Development Computer"**.

- **Authentication Method**:
   - You’ll be asked whether to use **Legacy Authentication** (for older MySQL clients) or **Strong Password Encryption**.
   - **Choose Strong Password Encryption** unless you specifically need compatibility with older systems.

2. **Set the root password**:
   - You will be prompted to set a **root password**. This password will be required to log in to MySQL.
   - **Make sure to remember it**! You will need it later.

3. **MySQL as a Windows Service**:
   - The installer will ask if you want to configure MySQL as a Windows service (which is recommended). It should be set by default.
   - You can also set MySQL to start **automatically** when Windows starts.

4. Click **Next** to proceed.

## Step 7: Apply Configuration
1. The installer will apply the configuration settings, install MySQL Server, and initialize the data directory.
2. It may take a few minutes to complete the installation.
3. When the configuration process finishes, click **Next**.

## Step 8: Install MySQL Workbench
1. The installer will automatically select **MySQL Workbench** if you chose the "Developer Default" option.
2. Click **Next** and continue with the installation.
3. Once the installation completes, click **Finish**.

## Step 9: Verify MySQL Server Installation
1. To verify that MySQL Server is running, press `Win + R`, type `services.msc`, and press Enter.
2. Scroll through the list of services and look for **MySQL** or **MySQL80** (depending on the version).
3. Ensure that the MySQL service is **running**.

4. Alternatively, open **Command Prompt** and run the following:
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p
Verify MySQL Server Installation

1. Enter the **root password** you set during installation.
2. If successful, you'll be logged into the **MySQL shell**.

## Step 10: Install and Open MySQL Workbench

1. Open **MySQL Workbench** from the Start Menu or from the desktop shortcut.
2. When MySQL Workbench starts, you’ll see the **Home Screen**. Click on the `+` button next to **MySQL Connections** to create a new connection.

### **Connection Settings**:
- **Connection Name**: Choose any name (e.g., `Local MySQL`).
- **Connection Method**: Choose **Standard (TCP/IP)**.
- **Hostname**: Use `localhost` (or `127.0.0.1`).
- **Port**: The default MySQL port is `3306`.
- **Username**: Enter `root` (the default MySQL root user).
- **Password**: Click on **Store in Vault** and enter the root password you set earlier.

3. Click **Test Connection** to verify the connection.
   - If it says **"Successfully made the MySQL connection"**, you're ready to go.
4. Click **OK** to save the connection settings.

## Step 11: Start Using MySQL Workbench

1. Double-click on the connection you created to open a new SQL tab.
2. You can now run SQL queries on your MySQL server.
